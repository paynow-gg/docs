# Authentication

## Types of Authentication

The PayNow API can be used both from a store management perspective, as well as a customer's perspective.

In order to support the different types of actors in our system, we have developed the following types of authentication:

### API Key

[API keys](api/api-key) are used to automate the management of a [store](api/store).
Whether it's pulling metrics, editing products, or generating customer tokens, API key are the correct way to
modify a store and its entities in a headless manner.

API keys can be created in the [API Keys section on the dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard/api-keys).

API keys can only be managed by a user.

### Customer

[Customers](api/customer) are the users of a store.
Customer tokens can generated with an [API request](api/customer#create-customer-token) by a [User](api/user) or [API Key](api/api-key).
These tokens allow a customer to access the resources of store they belong to, and manage their own customer account.


Customer tokens can be used from anywhere on the internet.
Whether it's your own website, your backend server, or from a game plugin, the customer token is the correct way to perform actions on behalf of a customer.

Customer tokens can be created in the [customer section on the dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard/customers).
Select a customer and then click "Create token".

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button
    href="/api/customer-token#customer-tokens"
    variant="text"
    arrow="right"
    children="Read more about customer tokens"
  />
</div>

### Game Server

[Game Servers](api/gameserver) represent the individual servers that you host.
Game Server tokens can be generated with an API request by a [User](api/user) or [API Key](api/api-key).

These are more restricted than API Keys because they can only access certain routes responsible for processing commands in-game.

Game Server tokens can be found in the [game server section on the dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard/gameservers).
Select a game server to see the token.

### User

[Users](api/user) are human users who are allowed to create and manage stores on the [dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard).

This section is added for completeness, and you should never share your user token or try to use it outside of the dashboard.

## Providing Authentication

Authentication is provided with the `Authorization` HTTP header in the format `Authorization: AUTH_PREFIX TOKEN`.

| Auth Type   | Auth Prefix  |
|-------------|--------------|
| API Key     | `apikey`     |
| Customer    | `customer`   |
| Game Server | `gameserver` |

*Auth prefixes are case insensitive.*

Example headers for the different types of authentication:
```yaml
Authorization: apikey 2HQQDow1G93rLVbRDe83tRP5vGDe442D2tT1XYNYYvbA
```
```yaml
Authorization: customer yArTi2CZekPCHyxjetxUfRnUMANF5hXBxHyDrf3Nia38gGtfJCqa1EJYReqDPUaaV1UNN1U
```
```yaml
Authorization: gameserver J7273cAJT7s3cP5WdSjJPtVCsLXK3bVfVPJimTX2YDT4
```

# Errors

The PayNow API uses a simple structure for errors.

## Error Response

<Row>
	<Col>
		<Fields>
			<Field name="status" type="integer">
				the HTTP status code for this error
			</Field>
			<Field name="code" type="string">
				the type of error
			</Field>
			<Field name="message" type="string">
				the error's message
			</Field>
			<Field name="errors" type="validation error" typeHref="#validation-error-structure" nullable>
				list of validation errors, only used for certain APIs
			</Field>
		</Fields>

		## Validation Error Structure

		<Fields>
			<Field name="code" type="string">
				the type of error
			</Field>
			<Field name="message" type="string">
				the error's message
			</Field>
			<Field name="path" type="string array">
				path to property that caused the error
			</Field>
			<Field name="validation" type="string">
				type of validation error
			</Field>
		</Fields>

		### Note
		In catastrophic cases, you might not get any of these values in response.
		This is however unlikely.

	</Col>

	<Col sticky>
		```json {{title: 'Example Error Response'}}
		{
			"status": 400,
			"code": "InvalidInput",
			"message": "cannot parse Steam ID from string: clearlynotasteamid"
		}
		```
