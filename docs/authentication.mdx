# Authentication

The PayNow API uses tokens for authentication.

## Types of Tokens

There are several types of tokens that can access the API.
The type of token being used can be specified with a prefix:

### API Token

***Header prefix:*** `APIKey`

API tokens are used to automate control of a [store](management-resources/store).
Whether it's pulling metrics, editing products, or generating customer tokens, API tokens are the preferred way to
modify a store and its entities in a headless manner.

API tokens can be created in the [API Keys section on the dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard/api-keys)

### Customer

***Header prefix:*** `Customer`

[Customers](management-resources/customer) are human users.
Customer tokens are generated by an API request by a User or API Token.
They allow a customer to access a single store and manage entities on their own customer account.

Customer tokens can be created in the [customer section on the dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard/customers).
Select a customer and click "Create token".

### Game Server

***Header prefix:*** `GameServer`

[Game Servers](management-resources/gameserver) are usually controlled from a plugin.
Game Server tokens are generated by an API request by a User or API Token.
These are more limited than API tokens because they can only access routes responsible for processing commands in-game.

Game Server tokens can be found in the [game server section on the dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard/gameservers).
Select a game server to see the token.

### User

***Header prefix:*** `User`

[Users](management-resources/user) are human users.
User tokens are generated by logging in to the [PayNow dashboard](https://paynow.gg/dashboard).
You should never share these or try to use them outside of the dashboard, ~~*but we know you will anyway*~~.

## Providing Authentication

Authentication is provided with the `Authorization` HTTP header.
Simply prefix your token with the appropriate [authentication type](#types-of-tokens).
Token prefixes are case insensitive.

Example header for an API key request:
```yaml
Authorization: apikey 2HQQDow1G93rLVbRDe83tRP5vGDe442D2tT1XYNYYvbA
```

Example header for a customer request:
```yaml
Authorization: customer yArTi2CZekPCHyxjetxUfRnUMANF5hXBxHyDrf3Nia38gGtfJCqa1EJYReqDPUaaV1UNN1U
```

Example header for a game server request:
```yaml
Authorization: gameserver J7273cAJT7s3cP5WdSjJPtVCsLXK3bVfVPJimTX2YDT4
```

Example header for a user request:
```yaml
Authorization: user xfvd57DcJosrXUahErawxsNeMmXkaGwVdPsCxUiMxqS3nBEUoWcMq7VyKXsp
```
