# Webhooks Introduction

Webhooks provide a powerful way for your application to receive real-time updates from our API. Instead of continuously polling our servers for new data, you can register a URL endpoint with us,
and we will send HTTP POST requests to that endpoint whenever certain events occur.

## How Webhooks Work
When you subscribe to a webhook event, you provide us with a URL that we will call whenever the event occurs. We will send a POST request to that URL with relevant data in the request body.
Your server then processes this data and performs any necessary actions.

## Setting Up Webhooks
To start getting webhook notifications, users can easily set up their webhook subscription using either our user-friendly dashboard or directly through our API.
It's a straightforward process: just provide the required details, like the events you're interested in and the URL endpoint where you want notifications to be sent.

## Webhook Types
Webhooks have multiple types, at the time of writing there are two:
- JSON (v1)
- Discord (v1)

These types dictate the format of the responses. The [Webhook Integration](/api/webhook-integration) only describes the JSON integration types.

Discord integration should be fairly straightforward: just create a Discord webhook,
create a PayNow webhook with the Discord webhook URL, select an event to listen for, customize your embed template, and you should be ready to go!

## Event Types
For a list of all PayNow API events that you can subscribe to, see [Webhook Events](/api/webhook-events)

## Handling Webhook Notifications
When your server receives a webhook notification, it should respond with an HTTP status code indicating whether the notification was successfully received and processed.
If your server responds with a non-successful status code (>299), we will automatically retry the webhook notification using an exponential backoff algorithm.
